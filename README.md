# Better Move Buttons
Redesigns the edit tab and overhauls the move buttons (kinda like BetterEdit but not)

Current features: 
- Overhauled move buttons (using a step system with customizable buttons instead of having different buttons for every type of move)
- Diagonal move buttons
- Independent row length for the edit tab
- Probably compatible with mods that add edit tab buttons* (I've tested with a few and it works fine)

**If you're using this with BetterEdit, turn off it's custom edit tab feature, it will probably break this mod.**
